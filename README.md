## Intro

Here you will find all the projects that I completed along with their GitHub Repo. This was a great course that taught me so much.

The course consisted of 40 lessons and 12 projects. Some of the concepts I learned:

-   Reviewing and learning concepts such as:
-   Using Vanilla JS to make UIs
-   DOM manipulation
-   Factory functions and the module pattern
-   OOP Principles
-   Webpack and npm
-   Asynchronous JavaScript
-   Frameworks (React and Vue)
-   Unit Testing (Jest)

This was not taught in class, but I went out of my way to practice other technologies and concepts that are needed to be a Frontend developer

-   Firebase
-   React Context
-   Styled Components
-   Material UI
-   React Bootstrap
-   Dribble (For design inspiration)
-   Gatsby Framework
-   Redux
-   Setting up projects with ESLint and Prettier

### Your Story

  - I challenged myself to create something new, something that could help people. As I was thinking, I realized that something that I value and that has helped me a lot is the power of reflection. Reflecting allows people to stop and think about what they are doing. Helps clarify what are the next steps you want to create and take. I wanted to create a tool that people can use to reflect. This is how Your Story was born!
