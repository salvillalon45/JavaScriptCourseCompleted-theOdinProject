## Intro

Here you will find all the projects that I completed along with their GitHub Repo. This was a great course that taught me so much.

The course consisted of 40 lessons and 12 projects. Some of the concepts I learned:

-   Reviewing and learning concepts such as:
-   Using Vanilla JS to make UIs
-   DOM manipulation
-   Factory functions and the module pattern
-   OOP Principles
-   Webpack and npm
-   Asynchronous JavaScript
-   Frameworks (React and Vue)
-   Unit Testing (Jest)

This was not taught in class, but I went out of my way to practice other technologies and concepts that are needed to be a Frontend developer

-   Firebase
-   React Context
-   Styled Components
-   Material UI
-   React Bootstrap
-   Dribble (For design inspiration)
-   Gatsby Framework
-   Redux
